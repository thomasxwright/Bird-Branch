# Introduction

Bird Branch is a hub for North American bird lovers.

---

# What can it do?

It has TWO primary features:

-An expansive encyclopedia of North American birds. Take a look and learn about the birds in your area! See photos, hear their calls, and read about each species.

-A hub where bird watchers who make accounts can keep track of their favorite species and log sightings of each bird they find in the wild!

# Where does the bird info come from?

I found a list of North American birds from NatureServe. Using that list, I looked up each of 1172 bird species and subspecies on Wikipedia and extracted their data from those pages.
